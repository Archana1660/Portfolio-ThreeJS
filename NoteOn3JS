1. <primitive>: refer link- https://threejs.org/manual/#en/primitives

- Primitives are generally 3D shapes that are generated at runtime with a bunch of parameters.
- It's especially common to use primitives to experiment and get started with 3D.
- exmaples: - BoxGeometry (A Box), PlaneGeometry (A 2D plane), WireframeGeometry
- with react we can use in

###

    const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
    function Component() {
      return <primitive object={mesh} position={[10, 0, 0]} />

2. <Canvas>: The Canvas object is where you start to define your React Three Fiber Scene.

- All you need to do is set the canvas frameloop prop to demand. It will render frames whenever it detects prop changes throughout the component tree. Here props related to <Canvas/> component
  <Canvas frameloop="demand"> values-always/demand/never

3. <OrbitControls>
   - minPolarAngle: How far you can orbit vertically, lower limit. Range is 0 to Math.PI radians, and default is 0
   - maxPolarAngle: How far you can orbit vertically, upper limit. Range is 0 to Math.PI radians, and default is Math.PI

4. useProgress from react/three/drei to show progress
5. <Html></Html> for the html to add in canvas
6. <motion.div/> from framer-motion
7. variant:
