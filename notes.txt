Things learnt:

1. REACT:
        1_1.  BrowserRouter component
        1_2.  <Suspense> lets you display a fallback until its children have finished loading.
        
        eg:     import { Suspense } from 'react';
                import Albums from './Albums.js';

                export default function ArtistPage({ artist }) {
                return (
                <>
                <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
                <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
                        <Albums artistId={artist.id} />
                </Suspense>
                </>
                );
                }

                function Loading() {
                return <h2>ðŸŒ€ Loading...</h2>;
                }

2.  Tailwind:

        2_1.   tems-center is align-items: center. This is for vertical positioning of elements

        2_2.   sm: is for media with minimum 640px max to any i.e <640px

        2_3.   flex-col and flex-row: col-direction and row-direction

        2_4. h-screen : to make an element span the entire height of the viewport.

        2_5. inset: properties written is same as the padding and margin (top, left, bottom, right)

                    - it's like margin, need to check the difference yet

                    - it has inset-block-start: applies on the top-left edge

                    - it has inset-block-end: applies on the bottom-left edge

                    - it has inset-inline-start: applies on the left side

                    - it has inset-inline-end: applies on the right side

                    - it has inset-inline: applies to both left and right side of the element

        2_6.    max-w-xl: to set maximum width of an element

 

To Check:

1. gap: space between rows and columns
2. flex-1
